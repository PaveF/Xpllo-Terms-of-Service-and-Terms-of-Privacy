Upload offensive or copyrighted images when using the change background command. (This is on the server owner's side)

Attempt to bypass the blacklist command or exploit bot vulnerabilities. (If you do it, pls tell me)

The bot is provided "as is." We do not guarantee 100% uptime. We reserve the right to:

Modify or discontinue features without notice.

Blacklist (remove) users or servers that violate these terms or Discord’s Community Guidelines.

# Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 9/1/2026

1. Data We Collect
To provide leveling services, we collect and store the following data:

User IDs: To track XP, levels, and individual settings.

Server IDs: To manage server-specific leaderboards and role configurations.

Message Metadata: We do not store the content of your messages. We only process the fact that a message was sent to award XP.

User-Provided Images: Any image URLs (any image in general) provided via the change background command.

Role IDs: Specifically for the setup role feature to automate rewards.

Last message ID: Idk why we need it, but it's useful.

2. How We Use Data
Your data is used strictly for:

Generating your rank card and the server leaderboard.

Assigning roles automatically based on your level.

Ensuring the blacklist command functions correctly to prevent specific users from gaining XP.

3. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties. Data is only accessible to the bot developers and host moderators for maintenance, troubleshooting, legal stuff, etc.

4. Data Retention and Deletion
Retention: Data is stored as long as the bot is in the server or until the user's data is manually reset.

Deletion: You may request data deletion by DMing vxa_020 on Discord. If the bot is kicked from a server, server-wide configuration data can be deleted manually.

5. Security
We implement standard security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
