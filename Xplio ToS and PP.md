To provide leveling services, we collect and store the following data:

User IDs: To track XP, levels, and individual settings.

Role IDs: Specifically for the setup role feature to automate rewards.

Last Message ID: Stored temporarily to calculate cooldowns, prevent spam, and ensure accurate XP attribution.

**2. How We Use Data**

Your data is used strictly for:

Generate your rank card and the server leaderboard.

Assigning roles automatically based on your level.

Ensuring the blacklist command functions correctly to prevent specific users from abusing the system.

**3. Data Sharing**

We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties. Data is only accessible to the bot developers and administrators for maintenance, troubleshooting, and legal compliance.

**4. Data Retention and Deletion**

Retention: Data is stored as long as the bot is in the server or until the user's data is manually reset.

We implement standard security measures to protect your data. However, please acknowledge that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
